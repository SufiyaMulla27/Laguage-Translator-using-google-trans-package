# Language Translator Application
This project is a simple language translator application that translates text between various languages. 
It uses the Googletrans library for translations and Tkinter for creating the user interface (UI). 
The application allows users to input text in one language and get the translated output in another selected language.

## Features
- Translate text between multiple languages.
- Easy-to-use graphical interface with text boxes for input and output.
- Dropdown menus to select source and target languages.
- Fast and accurate translation using Google's translation API.

The user inputs text into a text box, selects the source and target languages from dropdown menus, and clicks the "Translate" button. 
The translated text is displayed in another text box. It also shoes the timing required for the translation
